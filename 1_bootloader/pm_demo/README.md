# x86 Bootloader Framework - Open Source Demonstration

## Project Background
This is a **simplified, open-source demonstration** of a custom bootloader framework originally developed for enterprise clients. The production version was implemented for embedded systems requiring secure boot validation, real-time interrupt handling, and deterministic task scheduling.

**Note**: This public version demonstrates core concepts and architecture patterns from the commercial implementation, with simplified components for educational and demonstration purposes. The production system included additional complexity such as TPM hardware validation, encrypted boot verification, and enterprise-grade fault tolerance mechanisms.

## Purpose of This Demo

This project serves multiple objectives:

1. **Technical Portfolio**: Demonstrates system programming capabilities developed through commercial embedded systems work
2. **Architecture Showcase**: Exhibits design patterns and implementation strategies from enterprise bootloader development  
3. **Open Source Contribution**: Shares simplified versions of proven techniques with the systems programming community
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Documents core concepts that can benefit other developers working on similar low-level systems

## Original Commercial Requirements
The production implementation addressed specific client needs in embedded systems:
- **Hardware security validation**: TPM-based boot attestation and encrypted signature verification  
- **Real-time deterministic behavior**: Sub-millisecond interrupt handling for industrial control applications
- **Platform portability**: Support for multiple x86 embedded platforms with unified codebase
- **Regulatory compliance**: Security audit requirements for financial and automotive industries

## This Demo Version Includes
- **Core architecture patterns**: Same design principles as production system
- **Simplified security validation**: Checksum-based integrity checking (vs. TPM hardware in production)
- **Essential interrupt management**: Timer-based scheduling framework (simplified from production's complex priority system)
- **Proof-of-concept multitasking**: Basic preemptive scheduler demonstrating core concepts

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Layout
```
0x7C00:     Stage1 (MBR, 512 bytes)
0x60000:    Stage2 (Protected mode code)
0x90000:    Main 32-bit stack
Task stacks: Each task has 1KB stack within Stage2 area
0xB8000:    VGA text mode video memory
```

### Addressing Methods
- **Method A**: Runtime GDT base patching to CS<<4, immediate jump
- **Method B**: Flat memory model with base=0, indirect jump
- Both methods support all features and are functionally equivalent

### Context Switching Implementation
- Uses IRQ0 timer interrupt for preemptive scheduling
- Manual register save/restore (pushad/popad) for reliability
- PCB stores only ESP, full context on task stacks
- Initial task frames built to match interrupt return layout
